# Siteswap Families

I have seen many lists of siteswaps, personal and on the web, with many of them just random lists of numbers, and only sorted to amount of objects, and others are organized according to highest value in siteswap, and the length of a siteswap. 

What I have done is to organize siteswaps into families. 

I do this for two major reasons: 

- Firstly, when exploring any area of juggling, I like to explore areas, or families, with similar characteristics. 
- Secondly, these families are great ways of building up to siteswaps with more balls and/or higher throws, and also developing your skills in throwing particular heights.

Remember, when working on siteswaps that there is no definite height for a particular number. They need to be correct relative to one another. One major problem I have noticed is that people have their throws too close together. This will cause crashes, or make you loose your timing. 

Also, I think that 3’s in siteswap are one of the hardest heights to throw, and most people juggle them too high in relation to their other throws. Either make the 3’s smaller, or the other throws higher, or both.
