# Siteswap Families

Reviewing previous work on Siteswap Families, going into more depth with those original ideas, and exploring new ideas.

## Reviewing Previous Work

In 2005, possibly earlier*, I wrote an article titled "Siteswap Families".

This project will present that original piece, with minor edits, in a modern web format.

- [x] Copy original document into original.md
- [x] Update all content into Markdown styling 
- [ ] Review content for misspelling, punctuation, grammar, and layout issues
- [ ] Link document to main page of this project
- [ ] Consider breaking up document into smaller documents, using Jekyll 'includes'

## Going Deeper on Original Ideas

This project will then go deeper into those original ideas.

- [ ] Create a list of all sections of the original document, reviewing all aspects in more depth

## Exploring New Ideas

This project will also explore new ideas in Siteswap Families.

- [ ] Create a list of new ideas from notebooks, in order to work on further
- [ ] Request a review from other jugglers, asking for other siteswap families they know of

\* This reference made me think it was sometime around 2005:
