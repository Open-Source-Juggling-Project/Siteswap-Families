# Siteswap Families

Reviewing previous work on Siteswap Families, going into more depth with those original ideas, and exploring new ideas.

## Reviewing Previous Work

In 2005, possibly earlier (see [reference](docs/2005-Reference.md)), I wrote an article titled "Siteswap Families".

This project will present that original piece, with minor edits, in a modern web format.

## Going Deeper on Original Ideas

This project will then go deeper into those original ideas.

## Exploring New Ideas

This project will also explore new ideas in Siteswap Families.
